This SYSPARM ISPF-based command allocates the current PARMLIB
concatenation specified in your LOADxx member, and runs ISRDDN
against it.

You can achieve an equivalent result with the following
sequence of (purely IBM) commands:

DDLIST     (or TSO ISRDDN)
PARMLIB
ONLY PARMLIB

However, SYSPARM, if installed, is much simpler to invoke, and
it is done using ONE command, not THREE.

And it has the advantage that you see the source code, and you
can learn how this is done.
