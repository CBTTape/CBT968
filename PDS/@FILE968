//***FILE 968 is from John McKown and contains utilities written    *   FILE 968
//*           by him.  The first utility included is an             *   FILE 968
//*           ISRDDN-like TSO command called SYSPARM.  SYSPARM      *   FILE 968
//*           concatenates the PARMLIB datasets and performs an     *   FILE 968
//*           ISRDDN-like action on them, showing you your PARMLIB  *   FILE 968
//*           concatenation in ISRDDN format, so that you can see   *   FILE 968
//*           which members override, etc.                          *   FILE 968
//*                                                                 *   FILE 968

//*           Note that assembly/linkedit JCL is provided in        *   FILE 968
//*           member SYSPARM$, because the LE stuff has to be       *   FILE 968
//*           included, and it is not straightforward if you        *   FILE 968
//*           don't know how to include that stuff.                 *   FILE 968
//*                                                                 *   FILE 968
